# EventEmitter implemtation in C++
This is a header only library so just drag and drop the ``event-emitter`` directory into your include and ``#include "event-emitter/event-emitter.hpp"`` in your c++ program

# Still in developemnt and not to be used seriously 
You can use this if you want but i don't reccomend because i threw this together in 50 minutes

# How to use
look in ``examples/emitter.cpp`` for a basic test

cd into examples and run ``./build.sh`` to compile the tests

then cd into the build directory that got created and run ``./emitter``
