# EventEmitter implemtation in C++
This is a header only library so just drag and drop the ``event-emitter`` directory into your include and ``#include "event-emitter/event-emitter.hpp"`` in your c++ program

# Still in developemnt and not to be used seriously 
You can use this if you want but i don't reccomend because i threw this together in 50 minutes
